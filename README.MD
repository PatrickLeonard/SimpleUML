## Synopsis

A non-graphical Unified Modeling Language Class Diagram. The program uses a non-directed graph structure because with a Class Diagram the connections go either or both directions, and the relationships between the Classes need to be well formed and easily documented. 

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about C++ and it was also the subject of a college class using C++ to learn object oriented programming concepts. This program was for a second-year course in computer programming and object oriented programmming. 

## Installation

Compile using your favorite C++ compiler and execute the program on the command line, or you can try the makefile that is included and then execute the program.
